# History

The symbols of LexDAO have been:

- 🔯 summoning circle (6 sided from Morloch) - text version in Ross' 1st [tweet](https://twitter.com/lex_DAO/status/1196199188771540993) under @lex_DAO
- ⚖️ scales of justice, a universal symbol since Roman times for equal measure
- ⚔️ crossed swords reflecting contention

# NFT

The Ethereum wizard Kelvin Fichter summoned this LexDAO [emblem](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xef0ff94b152c00ed4620b149ee934f2f4a526387/10) with spritely swords and justice aflame. NFT is currently owned by James (LEETHodler). A subset was cropped for the picon. A subsequent celtic knot has been deprecated due to impossibility of relicensing.
