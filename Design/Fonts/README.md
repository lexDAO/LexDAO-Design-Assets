# Typeface Origin

1. Title = [Russo One Regular](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/russoone)
   - <details><summary>© <a href="mailto:lemonad@jovanny.ru">Jovanny Lemonad</a><br>Russo One is designed for headlines and logotypes. It is simple and original, stylish and casual.</summary><br><img src="https://localfonts.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Russo_One_950x475_02.png"><br>Russo means Russian. It seems strange that in a such font there is no snow, vodka or bears. What I wanted to show is that Russian culture is quite varied and modern. In Russia, too, some people love good fonts and typography.<br></details>
2. Text = [Baskerville](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/librebaskerville)
   - <details><summary>Libre Baskerville is web font optimized for body text (typically 16px.)</summary><br><img src="http://www.identifont.com/samples2/google/LibreBaskerville.gif"><br>It is based on the American Type Founder's Baskerville from 1941, but it has a taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast, that allow it to work well for reading on-screen.</details>
3. Annotation = [Shadow Into Light](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/shadowsintolight)
   - <details><summary>© Kimberly Geswein</summary><br><img src="http://www.identifont.com/samples2/google/ShadowsIntoLight.gif"><br>This clean, neat handwriting font has a feminine feel with nice rounded edges and curves. There is an updated <a href="https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/shadowsintolighttwo">version</a>a></details>
4. Chinese names = [Noto Serif SC]()
